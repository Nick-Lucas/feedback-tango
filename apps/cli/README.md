## Environment Variables

The CLI automatically loads environment variables from a `.env` file in your project root. Create a `.env` file with your Google API key:

```bash
# .env
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Alternatively, you can set the environment variable directly:

```bash
export GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Available AI Tools

The AI assistant has access to all database operations:

### Project Management

- Create, read, update, delete projects

## Tips

1. **Be Specific**: The more context you provide, the better the AI can help
2. **Use Commands**: For common tasks, the special commands are faster
3. **Natural Language**: You can ask questions in plain English
4. **Tool Results**: The AI will show you the actual database results when tools are used

## Troubleshooting

- **"Command not found"**: Make sure you've installed the CLI globally with `pnpm cli-install`
- **API Errors**: Check that your `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` is set correctly
- **Database Errors**: Ensure your database is set up and migrations have been run
